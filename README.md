## Download tweet video
You could just send any video tweet, such as this one 

https://twitter.com/BennyThinks/status/1306081739660427264?s=20

The bot will first determine if this is a video tweet, if the answer is yes, 
it will ask what do you want to do with it:

Depending on your choice, this bot will download this video or retweet.

## Inline mode

Once you have compose your tweet, hit the message to send you tweet.

**Be aware: using inline mode in another chat won't send tweet for you.** 

## multiple photo mode
**Group feature requires a newer version of Telegram**
Just send a group of photos, add some captions if you want to, and hit send.

**Warning: if you send more than four photos in a group, this bot will only send first four photos in a tweet**

## threaded-tweets
Twitter has max character limit of 280. If you want to send tweet more than this limit, you need to manually add new lines.

For example, one or more blank line is acceptable.
```
Dear developer, I was using teletweet for just few days and it made me so much curious and I stumble upon many things , that it should do more, so here I will just saying what can help me little,

Issue- Error: Text must be less than or equal to CHARACTER_LIMIT characters.

Need- when bot hit the wall of character limit, can this be possible that line break (Enter bottom) command can be used to split the
text into threading tweet, only when text limit breached from current tweet.
```
And the result would be

# Warning
## 1. Early development 
This bot is still under **early development process**. Anything may subject to change.
## 2. Data security
You need to use oauth to use this bot, and this bot will **save your oauth token** in its file system.
Under this circumstance, it means: 1). The bot will have access to your Twitter data 
2). the oauth token has been encrypted by AES-128-CBC. 
However, due to technical limitation, the encryption key is **available from host machine**, 
but I promise I won't do anything with your twitter account.
## 3. oauth token
The token was saved with **AES-128-CBC**, and the key is **available from the host machine**.
This means anyone have access to host machine could acquire key and decrypt the token.

Anyway, I promise I won't touch your token and Twitter account 
and I'll **do everything I can** to secure my host machine.

It's just like you're using a third party Twitter App, you trust it so you choose to use it. It's just like that.

Nevertheless, you could try to deploy your own bot - it's an open source project, you know.
