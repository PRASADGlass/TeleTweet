# TwitterBot
ðŸ¦‰ A telegram Twitter bot that will allow you to send tweets!

[TeleTweet](https://t.me/tele_tweetbot)

# Warning
## 1. Early development 
This bot is still under **early development process**. Anything may subject to change.
## 2. Data security
You need to use oauth to use this bot, and this bot will **save your oauth token** in its file system.
Under this circumstance, it means: 1). The bot will have access to your Twitter data 
2). the oauth token has been encrypted by AES-128-CBC. 
However, due to technical limitation, the encryption key is **available from host machine**, 
but I promise I won't do anything with your twitter account.
## 3. oauth token
The token was saved with **AES-128-CBC**, and the key is **available from the host machine**.
This means anyone have access to host machine could acquire key and decrypt the token.

Anyway, I promise I won't touch your token and Twitter account 
and I'll **do everything I can** to secure my host machine.

It's just like you're using a third party Twitter App, you trust it so you choose to use it. It's just like that.

Nevertheless, you could try to deploy your own bot - it's an open source project, you know.
